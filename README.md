The data used in this analysis is provided by Kagle for non-commercial purposes only, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. 
The Competition Data will contain private and public test sets. Which data belongs to which set are not made available to participants.

The competition goal is to predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. 
The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers.

The dataset was downloaded on Kaggle and describes the daily revenue resulting from sales by category during 4 years. 
The number of rows, therefore, show the first advantage of using Python: massive data analysis (that you usually can't perform using Microsoft Excel or similar).Â 
Since my first goal is to have a quick overview about the information represented by the 3 million of rows, I used four famous libraries that might also help you to analyse and visualize your data: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
